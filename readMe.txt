This web application fetches information about countries from an external API called restcountries.com. 
The user can search for a country and the application returns three parameters - population, area, and borders.

The population and area are then used to generate a background color using a function called numberToRGB. 
This function takes the population and area of the country and creates a corresponding RGB color for each.

The two colors generated are then used to create a background gradient.

The borders parameter is then used to randomly display lines on the screen, 
with the number of lines displayed based on the length of the borders array.

Overall, this application allows users to search for countries and displays information about them in a visually appealing way.
